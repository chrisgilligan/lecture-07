			<abstract>The MAJOR_RIVERS data set is a subset of the NHDPlus based on the associated THINNERCOD data that is delivered separately from the flowline geometry.

The NHDPlus Version 1.0 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial data sets that incorporate many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,000-scale NHD), improved networking, naming, and "value-added attributes" (VAA's). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed "The New-England Method". This technique involves "burning-in" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available  building "walls" using the national Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHD and WBD. An interdisciplinary team from the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, over the last two years has found this method to produce the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process.

The VAAs include greatly enhanced capabilities for upstream and downstream navigation, analysis and modeling. Examples include: retrieve all flowlines (predominantly confluence-to-confluence stream segments) and catchments upstream of a given flowline using queries rather than by slower flowline-by-flowline navigation; retrieve flowlines by stream order; subset a stream level path sorted in hydrologic order for stream profile mapping, analysis and plotting; and, calculate cumulative catchment attributes using streamlined VAA hydrologic sequencing routing attributes. 

The VAAs include results from the use of these cumulative routing techniques, including cumulative drainage areas, precipitation, temperature, and land cover distributions. Several of these cumulative attributes are used to estimate mean annual flow and velocity as part of the VAAs. 

The ThinnerCod is an ordinal value that helps to display various network densities. The ThinnerCod values range from 0 to 6. ThinnerCod=0 will show all non-networked flowlines, including coastlines and isolated flowlines not included in the network.  A ThinnerCod value of 1 contains the major rivers at a density appropriate for map displays at a small scale. The ThinnerCod = 1 is also very important because it has been built as the backbone network that connects all of the HUC-8's. This can be very useful when you want to extract a complete hydrologically networked set of HUC-8's as a subset of NHDPlus.  Increasing ThinnerCod values provide increasing density of the stream network.

NHDPlus contains a snapshot (2005) of the 1:100,000-scale NHD that has been extensively improved. While these updates will eventually make their way back to the central NHD repository at USGS, this will not have happened prior to distribution of NHDPlus because the update process for the central NHD repository is still in development. Consequently, the NHDPlus will contain some temporary database keys and, as a result, NHDPlus users may not make updates to the NHD portions of NHDPlus with the intent of sending these updates back to the USGS. Once the NHDPlus updates have been posted to the central NHD repository, a fresh copy of the improved data can be downloaded from the central NHD repository and that copy will be usable for data maintenance. Note that the NHDPlus products are tightly integrated and user modifications to the underlying NHD can compromise this synchronization.</abstract>
			<purpose>This data set is a subset of the NHDPlus based on the THINNERCOD data contained in a related table.

The geospatial data sets included in NHDPlus are intended to support a variety of water-related applications. They already have been used in an application to develop estimates of mean annual streamflow and velocity for each NHD flowline in the conterminous United States. The results of these analyses are included with the NHDPlus data. 

A water-quality model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) called SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes), can utilize the NHDPlus network functionality to track the downstream transport of nutrients, sediments, or other substances. NHDPlus water bodies and estimates of streamflow and velocity are used in SPARROW to identify reservoir retention and in-stream loss factors. NHDPlus climatic and land surface attributes can be used in SPARROW to identify potential factors in the delivery of nutrients from the land surface to streams. NHDPlus land cover information is useful for SPARROW in determining potential sources of nutrients. 

NHDPlus data is also being used in select areas for a USGS Web-based application, called StreamStats. StreamStats provides tools to interactively select any point on the NHDPlus to obtain streamflow and watershed characteristics for the selected point. 

NHDPlus has been designed to accommodate many users needs for future applications. NHDPlus provides the framework and tools necessary to customize the behavior of the network relationships as well as building upon the attribute database, for which the user can assign its own data to the network.</purpose>

				<procdesc>Downloaded NHDPlus shapefiles, tables, and data extension tables for NHD regions 07, 08, 10 (lower half), and 11.  Joined the Value Added Attributes (VAA) table (NHDFlowlineVAA.dbf) to the flowline shapefile for each region.  Applied a definition query to each regional shapefile to select only those segments that had a THINNERCOD equal to 1 ("THINNERCOD" = 1).  Exported the resulting selection to a new Major Rivers shapefile for each region.  The regional major rivers shapefiles were then combined into a single shapefile and then intersected with the WBD_8 data set to select only those river segments that are located within the watersheds that intersect the state of Missouri.  The resulting selection set was then exported to the final Major Rivers shapefile.  Attribute fields that were not populated or did not provide any useful information were deleted.  Updated the metadata to include information about the NHDFlowlineVAA.dbf table that was joined to the NHDPlus data.

				<attrlabl>GNIS_ID</attrlabl>
				<attrdef>A permanent, unique number assigned to a geographic feature for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying that feature as a record in any information system database, dataset, file, or document and for distinguishing it from all other feature records so identified. The number is assigned sequentially (highest existing number plus one) to new records as they are created in the Geographic Names Information System. The number, by design, carries no information or association to the content of the feature record and therefore is not subject to change as attribute values change. Once assigned to a feature, the number is never changed or withdrawn, and never reassigned. The Feature ID can be applied in conjunction with system-unique record identifiers in any database or system, thus providing a national standard common reference identifier across multiple datasets. The Feature ID is stored in the GNIS database as an integer with a maximum of ten digits.  Blank if unknown.</attrdef>

				<attrlabl>GNIS_NAME</attrlabl>
				<attrdef>A geographic feature name and its written form and application approved or recognized as official by the United States Board on Geographic Names for use throughout the Federal Government. The official name is established either by policy or by decision of the Board on Geographic Names. It is the proper name, specific term, or expression by which a particular geographic entity is, or was, known. A geographic feature may have only one official name, which must be the name applied to the feature on all Federal products, electronic or printed.  Blank if unknown.</attrdef>
